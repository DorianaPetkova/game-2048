      <h2>Playthrough</h2>
       <p>
        When you first run the game you see a menu with options.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you start the game you are prompted to enter username and board size.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then you play! Your current score, max tile and moves are shown at all times.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you enter an invalid move or a move that does nothing, messages appear accordingly.
      </p>
       <p>
        When you want to quit your result is saved!
      </p>
      <p>
       When you're out of moves, it's game over and you can return to the main menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instructions show a quick guide on how to play.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you want to see the leaderboards, you are asked which size. The best 5 results show.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you press exit, the program closes!
